# Design Principles

The MLA is designed to greatly simplify the assessment process for instructors in college courses.
Its main function is to aid in the creation, grading, and grade reporting of weekly exams.

We make the following assumptions:
* each course is taught by a small number of instructors
  * if there are multiple instructors for a course, then they will all give the same exam at the same time each week
* the final grade is based on the number of skills a student has mastered by the end of the course
  * each week the students have an exam with one (hard) question for each skill that has been introduced so far which they haven't yet mastered
  * the students' answers are graded mastered/not-mastered with no partial credit
* each skill has an associated problem bank of hard questions that are used to construct the weekly exams
* when an instructor creates a course they can import the skills from a previous semester (and the associated problem banks)
  * they are free to modify the name and description of the skill
  * they can add new skills but must then create the problem bank for that skill
  * they can remove skills from the new course
