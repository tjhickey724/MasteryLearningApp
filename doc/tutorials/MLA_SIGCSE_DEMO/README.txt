We can test MLA0 by creating an initial roster,
and creating 3 exams and 3 makeups

1) Start by creating a new course.
2) Next go to the Enrollment tab and upload roster1-7.csv 
   roster1-7.csv has students 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 in 2 sections
3) Next import all of the skills from the Discrete Math Problem Bank class
4) Next create an exam, with problems for F01 and F02.
5) Next generate personalized exams for your seven students
   in a downloaded zip file. Run the "compile.sh" file to compiled the
   latex into pdfs, which you could then print.
6) Next upload the grades using exam1.csv
   exam1.csv has students 1,2,3 taking an exam with two skills, F01,F02
